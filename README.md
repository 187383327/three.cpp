# Three/Qt
yet another C++ port of three.js, based on Three.js r86+ and a few of the Qt framework's OpenGL classes

Also comes with an integration into QML (aka QtQuick) in the form of a QML item

Currently in pre-alpha state. Code is being ported and translated, but nothing has been tested or can be expected to be running yet.

Contributors welcome anytime
